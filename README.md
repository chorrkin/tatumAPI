# Jayson Tatum Performance Analysis  

## Overview  
This project uses Python and the NBA API to analyze NBA player statistics, with a specific focus on highlighting Jayson Tatum's performance compared to other players. The analysis includes key metrics such as **True Shooting Percentage (TS%)**, **Simplified Player Efficiency Rating (PER)**, and a composite metric of **Points, Rebounds, and Assists (PST_REB_AST)**. Interactive visualizations are used to present these comparisons effectively.  

## Features  
- Fetches real-time player statistics from the NBA API.  
- Calculates advanced basketball metrics like TS%, Simplified PER, and PST_REB_AST.  
- Creates bar graphs and radar charts to visualize player comparisons.  
- Highlights Jayson Tatum’s performance in key areas compared to peers.
